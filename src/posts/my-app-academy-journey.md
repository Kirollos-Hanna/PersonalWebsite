## Introduction

&nbsp;

The [Appacademy open](https://open.appacademy.io/) curriculum is offered by the folks over at [Appacademy](https://www.appacademy.io/) completely for free for anyone with internet access and a good computer to program on.

&nbsp;

I decided to try my hand at finishing the whole curriculum first hand as a way of making progress in my development journey since I have a hard time focusing when out in the wild.

&nbsp;

A little bit of background on me. I've started programming in 2016 trying to get into game development but I failed to realize how monumentally insane my expectaions were and quit a few months into it. (I wanted to make a GTA clone on my own, which I now realize... is INSANE) The amount of work required to make a simple character in a game from conception and modeling to the mechanics of its movements and how it interacts with the world; There is a job for each step on this process and that's just for the characters.

&nbsp;

But I'm getting sidetracked. Eventually, I got into web development and studied using FreeCodeCamp and Udemy courses and have pretty much been in tutorial hell ever since.

&nbsp;

Now that I wrote this out, I realize this is just a continuation of my journey in tutorial hell but at least I'll be building projects in this curriculum.

&nbsp;

I'll be updating this blog post on occasion whenever I finish a part of the curriculum and give you my thoughts on each part.

## Welcome to Coding

&nbsp;

If you're starting from scratch and don't know anything about programming. This section alone should give you an idea of what you'll be able to do with your new found knowledge.

&nbsp;

You'll get introduced to the curriculum and you'll modify some code for a reddit scrapper. There isn't much thinking involved since they guide you through each step of the way.

&nbsp;

Consider this the hook that will make you want to keep going through the rest of this ~~hell~~ curriculum. <strong style="font-size: 12px;"> (haha, fun times ahead)</strong>
